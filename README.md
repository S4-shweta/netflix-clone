# netflix-clone

During the process of cloning the Netflix website, I've implemented several significant changes to make it unique while preserving the core functionalities that users love.
firstly i linked the css file to html file.then One of the most exciting additions we've made is the "Download" button. Now you can enjoy your favorite movies and
TV shows offline, whether you're on a long flight or simply want to save on data usage. With just a click, you can download content to watch later at your convenience.
 notice that sleek and intuitive user interface, designed to make navigation a breeze. I've added a prominent "Sign Up" button right at the top, 
 inviting you to create your account and unlock a world of entertainment.
